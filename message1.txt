Perfect! Since you're using *Cloudera VM (on Oracle VirtualBox), Hive is already pre-installed and integrated with Hadoop, making it ideal for performing **descriptive analytics and basic statistics* using HiveQL.

## ðŸ§ª *EXPERIMENT: Create Hive Database and Perform Descriptive Analytics (Basic Statistics)*

---

### ðŸŽ¯ *Aim:*

To create a database and table in Apache Hive and perform basic statistical operations such as MIN, MAX, AVG, COUNT, and SUM.

---

### ðŸ§  *Theory:*

Apache Hive is a *data warehouse system* built on top of Hadoop for querying and analyzing large datasets stored in HDFS using SQL-like syntax called *HiveQL*.

Hive converts SQL-like queries into MapReduce jobs internally, making it scalable for big data processing.

## âš™ *Steps to Perform in Cloudera VM*

### âœ… Step 1: Open Hive Shell

In your Cloudera VM terminal:

bash
hive


---

### âœ… Step 2: Create a Database

sql
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
USE student_db;


---

### âœ… Step 3: Create a Table

sql
CREATE TABLE marks (
    name STRING,
    subject STRING,
    marks INT
)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
STORED AS TEXTFILE;


---

### âœ… Step 4: Load Sample Data into Hive Table

1. First, create a CSV file on your VM:

bash
gedit marks.csv


Paste this data:


Alice,Math,85
Bob,Math,75
Alice,Science,90
Bob,Science,80
Charlie,Math,60
Charlie,Science,70


Save and close.

2. Move it to HDFS:

bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/cloudera/hive_input
hdfs dfs -put marks.csv /user/cloudera/hive_input/


3. Load into the Hive table:

sql
LOAD DATA INPATH '/user/cloudera/hive_input/marks.csv' INTO TABLE marks;


---

### âœ… Step 5: Run Descriptive Analytics Queries

#### âž¤ Get All Records

sql
SELECT * FROM marks;


#### âž¤ Total Number of Rows

sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM marks;


#### âž¤ Average Marks

sql
SELECT AVG(marks) FROM marks;


#### âž¤ Minimum and Maximum Marks

sql
SELECT MIN(marks), MAX(marks) FROM marks;


#### âž¤ Total Marks by Student

sql
SELECT name, SUM(marks) AS total_marks FROM marks GROUP BY name;


#### âž¤ Average Marks by Subject

sql
SELECT subject, AVG(marks) AS avg_marks FROM marks GROUP BY subject;


---

### ðŸ“Œ Optional: Describe Table

sql
DESCRIBE marks;


---

## âœ… *Conclusion:*

Successfully created a Hive database and table, inserted sample data, and performed descriptive analytics using HiveQL functions like COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX, and SUM.
